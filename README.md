# microtubule_catastrophe

This was the final group project for the Introduction to data analysis in the biological sciences course I took. As a result, I did not write everything, but I did substantial work on this project. The hw9.3.ipynb file contains the Jupyter notebook where everything is run from. The .py files are supporting files as to not crowd the file.
